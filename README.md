Verse 1
Who's taking you home
We been partying on night long
So before this night is gone
Tell me who's taking you home
Who's taking you home
Please correct me if I'm wrong
But I feel this connection is so strong
So tell me who's taking you home
Girl I'm looking at your body
and there ain't nobody better
(ain't nobody better)
And we're the flyest in this party
we're supposed to be together
(supposed to be together)
So I'm asking
Chorus
Who's taking you home
Tell me who's taking you home
Girl before this night is gone
Tell me who's taking you home
Who's taking you home
Tell me who's taking you home
Girl before this night is gone
Tell me who's taking you home
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tell me who's taking you home
Verse 2
Who's taking you home (tell me girl)
Hope I'm not coming on too strong
But you way too fly to be alone
So tell who's taking you home
This attraction is full on
Girl your body's got me gone
So let's dance to one more song
And tell me who's taking you home
Cause I'm looking at your body
and there ain't nobody better
(ain't nobody better)
And we're the flyest in this party
we're supposed to be together
(supposed to be together)
Said I'm looking at your body
and there ain't nobody better
(ain't nobody better)
And we're the flyest in this party
we're supposed to be together
(supposed to be together)
So I'm asking
Chorus
Who's taking you home
Tell me who's taking you home
Girl before this night is gone
Tell me who's taking you home
Who's taking you home
Tell me who's taking you home
Girl before this night is gone
Tell me who's taking you home
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tell me who's taking you home
